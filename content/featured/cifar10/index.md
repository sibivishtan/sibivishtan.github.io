Trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)and Densenet Convolution on the CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,00032 x 32 colour images, to classify images into 10 different classes. Shown the ability to handle large datasets and leverage advanced techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification and generation.
